# Frame Editor

This directory contains the frame editor modes that power the animation editor window.

* `movement/` - existing movement editing widgets and panels.
* `children/` - placeholder for future child-frame management tools.
* `attacking/` - placeholder for future attack and hit geometry configuration tools.

`FrameEditor` lives at the root of this folder and is responsible for switching between the
different modes.
